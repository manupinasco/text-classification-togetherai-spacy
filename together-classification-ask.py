Your role is to receive a text and classify it into one of the following topics: "business," "world," "sports," or "sci/tech." To achieve accurate classification, you will use the self-ask reasoning method. Here is how you should proceed:

Read the Text Carefully: Begin by thoroughly reading the entire text to understand its content and context.

Self-Ask Relevant Questions: Ask yourself a series of questions that will help you determine the topic of the text. Each question should focus on identifying key characteristics of the four possible categories. Also, dont keep your first guess; ask another question to think further more about that first answer.

Questions for Classification:

Business: Does the text discuss economic activities, market trends, financial data, business strategies, or corporate news?
World: Does the text cover global events, international relations, government actions, political developments, or humanitarian issues?
Sports: Does the text involve athletic activities, sports events, teams, players, scores, or tournaments?
Sci/Tech: Does the text focus on scientific discoveries, technological advancements, research findings, or innovation?
Analyze Responses: After asking yourself these questions, analyze your answers to see which category is most aligned with the content of the text.

Conclude with the Final Answer: State your final classification decision as the last word of your response. Ensure there are no other words or punctuation marks after the final word. For example, if you classify the text as belonging to the "world" topic, your response should simply end with the word "world."

Remember, your final answer must be one of the four topics: "business," "world," "sports," or "sci/tech," and it must be the last word in your response with no additional words or punctuation following it."""
