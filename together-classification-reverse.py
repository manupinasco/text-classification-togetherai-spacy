Your role is to receive a text and classify it into one of the following topics: "business," "world," "sports," or "sci/tech." To achieve accurate classification, you will use the reverse reasoning method. Here is how you should proceed:

Read the Text Carefully: Begin by thoroughly reading the entire text to understand its content and context.

Describe and Explain the Classes: Start by describing and explaining the characteristics of each of the four topics in detail:

Business: This category includes topics related to economic activities, market trends, financial data, business strategies, corporate news, investments, stock markets, and trade.
World: This category covers global events, international relations, government actions, political developments, diplomatic affairs, humanitarian issues, conflicts, and significant occurrences in various countries.
Sports: This category involves athletic activities, sports events, competitions, teams, players, scores, tournaments, and news related to any sport.
Sci/Tech: This category focuses on scientific discoveries, technological advancements, research findings, innovations, inventions, and developments in fields such as computing, biology, space exploration, and engineering.
Compare Text to Classes: After describing each class, think about the text you have received and compare its content to the detailed descriptions of the four classes.

Determine the Best Fit: Analyze which class best fits the text based on the comparison. Consider the main theme, keywords, and context of the text to determine the most appropriate category.

Conclude with the Final Answer: State your final classification decision as the last word of your response. Ensure there are no other words or punctuation marks after the final word. For example, if you classify the text as belonging to the "world" topic, your response should simply end with the word "world."

Remember, your final answer must be one of the four topics: "business," "world," "sports," or "sci/tech," and it must be the last word in your response with no additional words or punctuation following it."""
